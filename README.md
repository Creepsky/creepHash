# freedomhash Miner

Please note we're currently in Beta and the system is not 100% perfect yet. Give us your feedback so we can make it better.

Go to freedomhash.com and download the Miner. 

Select the Coin you wish to be paid in on the website and insert your address there.

It will give you the command to run the Miner. 
You can start it directly via Commandline by cd /thefolderwhereyoulocatedtheminerin
or create a bat file and copy that line into the bat file.

As example your Command should look like this:

multiMiner.exe.exe -uri=http://5.39.93.90 -coin=ETH -address=0x15042494c1e0f78bc344f43c2de2252e1bfcacae -U/-G

The miner will mine whatever is most profitable together with all other miners using our system at the same time.
Every valid share will be written to our database, whenever we recieve a payment from a pool we'll split it according to the shares in our database
and exchange it automaticaly to the coins our Miners selected. 
As we combine all our hashrates together the system works better the more miner we have, so we get faster and more frequent payouts.

If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Yours sincerly

FreedomHash Team
