4. Download the [latest Miner](https://github.com/Creepsky/creepHash/releases)
5. Copy and run the command that is shown

The command should look like this:

`creepHash.exe -uri=http://5.39.93.90:3001 -coin=ETH -address=0x15042494c1e0f78bc344f43c2de2252e1bfcacae`

## Run the miner

On first startup, the miner will **benchmark** your mining hardware. These benchmarks are used to determine the most profitable coin for you to mine. 

All earned coins will be automaticaly exchanged to the coin you've choosen. You don't need any other wallets or worry about finding pools and setting everything up. 
You will get payments according to the shares you submitted in the coin you have chosen.

Whenever there is a more profitable coin to mine, the miner switches automatically - you don't have to do anything.



If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Yours sincerly

creepHash Team
